# atom-puppet-module-generator

All credit goes to [Alexey Sokolov](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov) who made the nice package [atom-smart-template](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov/atom-smart-template), I'm just expanding his great code.

This package provides an easy way to generate templated Puppet module code as a starting point.

**NOTE**: Seems to be incompatible with [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/) at the moment.

### Usage
Right click the folder where you want to add files and select **Generate Puppet Module**
